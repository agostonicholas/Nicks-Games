      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div style="font-size: 13px; font-family: 'Press Start 2P', cursive;">
          I am Nick and this is my website where I will<br>
           be coding small games and uploading them for people to play.<br>
          Hopefully they are enjoyable enough but,<br> 
          the first few might be a bit rough. This is meant to be a testament<br> 
          to my progress as a programmer and a game developer.<br> 
          Currently I am working on my Associates degree in Computer Science at<br> 
          SNHU and I will be going to complete my bachelors soon after.<br> 
          I have been programming for maybe a year now and this is the first<br> 
          project I am trying to focus on fully.<br>
          It's hard to focus on one thing when there are so many different<br> 
          languages and fields to learn about.<br> 
          Anyways, I hope you enjoy my games <br>
          and if you have any questions or suggestions,<br> 
          feel free to reach out!
